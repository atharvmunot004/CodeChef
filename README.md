# CodeChef

Dear readers, on this repository, I'll be sharing the codes I write for the problems I solve in CodeChef.
I'm aiming to improve my programming and logical abilities in this journey.

While solving the questions, I tend to stick to pen and paper to initially build my logic, and once I've solved the problem in theory; I will code it down.
In this process, the logic that I've used will only be visible to you in the form of code, I strongly insist that you clearly understand the logic (by doing dry runs of the code 
or by asking ChatGPT to explain it) and not just copy the code. 

I hope that this repository helps and brings you much joy and fun as it will to me.

Warm Regards,
Atharv Munot
